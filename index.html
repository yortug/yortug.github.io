<a href="cbh_intranet_article/cbh_analyst_to_rpo_article.pdf" style="font-size: 18px;">CBH Intranet Article</a>
- during the 2021/22 WA grain harvest i spent ~10 weeks in Ravensthorpe working as a frontline operator
- this is an article that was posted on the CBH intranet about my work out in the field
- i gained a much deeper knowledge, and appreciation, for how the business operates
- it was challenging at times, but overall it was a great experience!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDG_xzo6Pho" style="font-size: 18px;">CBH Rainfall Chart Generator</a>
- a simple and lightweight visualisation tool i created using javascript & d3.js
- simply upload a correctly formatted CSV and you'll get a sleek "rainfall visualisation" in return
- many parts of the visualisation can be tweaked on the fly (dimensions, colour, smoothing, axes, etc.)
- once happy with the look/feel of the visualisation you can download it as both a .png and .svg
- this tool has produced countless visualisations which have been used all across the CBH business
    + board presentations
    + senior management presentations
    + frontline operator presentations
    + grower engagement presentations

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4nAQ6SJfrM" style="font-size: 18px;">CBH Catcher Tool</a>
- the "Catcher tool" is a bespoke analytics tool i created that has been used across CBH for a couple years now
- this is a crucial tool within the CBH Operations Planning team (my team) as it helps better inform network investment
- this tool gives us a rough idea of the impact that major changes to our supply-chain network might have:
    + how many tonnes will a new site attract?
    + if we change the storage costs at our site, how many tonnes will we lose/gain?
    + where will the tonnes go if we shutdown site-abc?
- it was built in R using the Shiny package, and is hosted on-prem using ShinyProxy
- the road distances necessary to build the catchments are generated using openrouteservice
- the version being shown is two-years old, there have been minor changes since, but i still have plenty of ideas

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YpEI2zWS9s" style="font-size: 18px;">CBH GraphQL Mockup</a>
- this was a simple proof-of-concept project i worked on to try better understand data driven web-apps
- after seeing what airbnb's visx was capable of, i was inspired to try and learn how i could leverage it
- i used typescript, typegraphql, apollo, typeORM, react and visx - and somehow i made something work
- although the output is simple, all the magic which makes it work took a massive amount of learning
- i come from a R/Python procedural programming background, so understanding APIs is a massive hurdle
- learning within this domain was extremelly enjoyable/satisfying, and i really want to improve these skills

<a href="alcoa_industry_project/data_fueled_maintenance_in_mining.pdf" style="font-size: 18px;">Alcoa Industry Project</a>
- data fueled maintenance in mining
- this was a project i undertook with Alcoa during my final semester of studying my BSc (data science)
- i used real engine oil sample data taken from actual haul-trucks (CAT789Ds, among others)
- i reproduced the methodology put forwards from a previous published paper on this topic, and then built upon it
- i worked extremely closely with the reliability engineers to ensure my thinking/results made sense  
- a set of recommendations based on the analysis were put forwards at the end of the report
- presentation can be found <a href="alcoa_industry_project_presentation/index.html">here</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hJMYD79oveI" style="font-size: 18px;">Alcoa Mockup Dashboard</a>
- this was a mockup dashboard which i made during my vacation work at Alcoa
- the dashboard was showcased to senior management as a means to showcase the potential of data science in refining
- although the dashboard itself was a mockup, the data being used was and the business problem were both real
- along with creating this dashboard for management, i also audited the predictive model the dashboard was based upon
- (this video has no sound!)

<a href="tree_based_outlier_detection/tree_based_outlier_detection.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Tree Based Outlier Detection</a>
- a dive into how tree-based methods for outlier detection work
- mainly concerned with Isolation Forests (IF) and Extended Isolation Forests (EIF)
- use a common dataset (thyroid function) to compare anomaly scoring the two algorithms
    + leveraging sklearn implementation of IF
    + leveraging the author implementation of EIF (and IF)
    + outlier detection accuracy for both methods
    + anomaly scoring regions (ghosting)
    + etc. etc. etc.
- in order to visualise the data PCA was utilised to reduce the dimensionality to 2D
- all plots were designed to be interactive leveraging the Plotly library
- in the future this entire analysis should be completed across a couple other outlier datasets
- presentation can be found <a href="tree_based_outlier_detection_presentation/index.html">here</a>

<a href="data_mining_assignment/data_mining_assignment.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Data Mining Exercise</a>
- given a dataset with a mixture of categorical and numeric variables, with a target class to predict
- have to exercise the data mining skills required to clean and process the data
    + missing data
    + type casting
    + feature scaling
    + feature selections
    + etc. etc. etc.
- after data cleaning & pre-preocessing was completed, numerous classification models were fit
- this was an exercise in truly diving deep into the sklearn framework (previously unexplored)
- many avenues for research and extended reading/experimentation have come out of this exercise

<a href="optimal_portfolio/optimal_portfolio.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Optimal Portfolio S&P 500</a>
- finding the optimal set of stocks to include within an equity portfolio
- restricted to only using companies who're listed on S&P 500
- the project focuses on finding the optimal weights to distribute a hypothetical $10 million across all stocks
- the final portfolio showcases roughly $1 million profit when it was tested over the Jan-2018 to Jul-2018 period
- as we don't have $10 million to spare, (unfortunately) no money was actually thrown down

<a href="predicting_aromaticity/predicting_aromaticity.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Predicting Aromaticity In Diesel Fuels</a>
- predicting the amount of aromaticity (an 'impurity') in diesel fuels using spectroscopy data
- we go through the process of reducing our large feature set using stepwise variable reduction methods
- we then model this relationship starting with simple linear regression, and moving to the multivariate space
- methods of partial least squares and LASSO are also demonstrated
- showcased some basic, static visualisations looking at model assumptions, outliers, leverage, etc.
- you should (hopefully) be able to understand the introduction and conclusion with almost no prior knowledge


<a href="https://github.com/yortug/electoral-campaign" style="font-size: 18px;">Finding an Optimal Campaign Trail</a>
- an assignment used to learn and explore data structures & algorithms
- scraped wikipedia for the coordinates of all Australian voting electorates
- fed these coordinates through GoogleMap's API to find the estimated driving distance & time
- used this data in combination with the 2016 election data to model an optimal campaign route given a set of 'marginal elecorates'
- documentation.pdf file in the repo explains the project in a lot more depth
- implemented a terminal based program which gives you the option to:
    + filter candidates by state, electorate and party
    + search for candidates by name
    + find a set of marginal electorates
    + find an optimal campaign route through marginal electorates

<a href="weather_analysis/weather_analysis.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Perth Weather Analysis</a>
- a basic look at the weather patterns within Perth (using 2016 BOM data)
- heavy use of the python package 'bokeh' to make my visualisations dynamic and interactive
- the project explores the data to provide evidence for the suitability of renewable energy
- looking into questions like; wind or solar? are we in or heading towards a drought?
- unfortunately BOM doesn't have the data available anymore, still should work, just updating it was a challenge

<a href="afl_project/afl_project.html" style="font-size: 18px;">AFL (Australian Football League) Win/Loss Predictions</a>
- a loose attempt at trying to predict AFL wins and losses
- one of my first projects ever attempted, so the data wrangling, exploration and cleaning is rather basic
- somewhat naively apply logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours and decision trees/random forests
- quite a vast emphasis on visualisation (histograms, pie charts, stacked bar plots, etc.)

<a href="drug_dosage/drug_dosage.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Drug Dosage Simulator</a>
- a drug dosage simulation project, one of my first projects within python
- an attempt to find the optimal dosage of two 'drugs'
- really a test in understanding the language; reading & outputting to files, creating shell scripts, etc.
- although the 'drugs' are contrived examples, the absorbtion formula and the working is actually legitimate

<a href="text_scrape/text_scrape.html" style="font-size: 18px;">Website Text-Scrape & NLP Wordcloud</a>
- a project scraping unstructured, untouched text from an infamous image/discussion board
- then processing that data into something in which a word frequency can be calculated
- a wordcloud visualisation was then created to display the most used words within this sample
- very basic, and not too flashy, but it was just a project carried out in the holidays out of boredom
